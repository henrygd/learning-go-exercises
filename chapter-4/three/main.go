// Start a new program. In main, declare an int variable called total. Write a for
// loop that uses a variable named i to iterate from 0 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive).
// The body of the for loop should be as follows:
// total := total + i
// fmt.Println(total)
// After the for loop, print out the value of total. What is printed out? What is the
// likely bug in this code?

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var total int

	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		total := total + i
		fmt.Println(total)
	}

	fmt.Println(total)
}

// bug is that total is shadowed
