// Write a program that defines a struct called Employee with three fields:
// firstName, lastName, and id. The first two fields are of type string, and the
// last field (id) is of type int. Create three instances of this struct using whatever
// values youâ€™d like. Initialize the first one using the struct literal style without
// names, the second using the struct literal style with names, and the third with a
// var declaration. Use dot notation to populate the fields in the third struct. Print
// out all three structs.

package main

import "fmt"

type Employee struct {
	firstName string
	lastName  string
	id        int
}

func main() {
	first := Employee{
		id: 9528,
	}
	second := Employee{
		firstName: "Homer",
		lastName:  "Simpson",
	}
	var third Employee

	third.firstName = "Marge"
	third.lastName = "Simpson"
	third.id = 8923

	fmt.Println(first)
	fmt.Println(second)
	fmt.Println(third)
}
